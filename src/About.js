                <p>Hello! My name is Pushpesh and I enjoy building things 
                    for the internet. I started my journey with python 
                    and eventually moved to web development. When I see a
                     great website I get curious about how these websites 
                     are made I just open my dev tools and start figuring 
                     out things. I try my best to give the best interface to the
                      user and also by making it beautiful.</p>

                <p>I like to learn up new things, to read 
                   books on various topics I kinda try to figure
                   things out and I am learning Daily!</p>

            <div className="square">
                <img src="./images/pushpesh.jpeg" alt="Pushpesh"/>
            </div>
        </div>
        </div>
    )
}
